 //ediptive Questions
        //Qno1. What is a variable in C++?
        //Define a variable and explain its purpose in C++.


cout<<" Ans1. store the value with the help of data type"<<endl;
cout<<"example:"<<endl;
 int  a=6;
 cout<< a <<endl;
float y=5.55;
 cout<< y <<endl;
 
 
 
  //Qno2. What data type would you use to store an age in C++?
//Give an example of how to declare and initialize such a variable

cout<<"Ans2.  we can store age in int"<<endl;
cout<<"example"<<endl;
int age=18;
cout<< age <<endl;


//Qno3. What does the int data type store?
//Provide an example.

cout<<"Ans3. int store only integers number"<<endl;
cout<<"example"<<endl;

 int ab=3.33;
 cout<< ab <<endl;
    
    
    
    //Qno4. Explain the difference between float and double data types.
    cout<<"Ans4. float can hold 6-7 digits after decimal"<<endl; cout<<"double can hold 15-16 digits after decimal"<<endl;


//Qno5. What data type would you use to store a character?
//Provide an example of how to declare and initialize this variable.
 cout<<"Ans5. char can store only single letter, numbers or symbol"<<endl;
 cout<<"example"<<endl;
 char gender= 'M';

 cout<< gender <<endl;
 
 //Qno6. What is the default value of a bool variable in C++?
//Provide a short example where true and false values are used.



//Qno7. Declare a variable x of type int and assign it the value of 10.
 cout<<"Ans7. example"<<endl;
 int x=10;
 cout<< x <<endl;
 

//Qno8. How do you assign one value to multiple variables in C++?
//Provide an example using variables a, b, and c.


//Qno9. What is the purpose of using the const keyword in C++?
//Wite a short example where a constant variable is used.
cout<<"Ans9. if we use the const keyword in a datatype then that variable is locked then we can not modified value of variable"<<endl;
cout<<"EXAMPLE: const int s = 10; this is locked"<<endl;


//Qno10.What is the rule for naming variables in C++?
//List at least three naming conventions or rules for valid identifiers.
cout<<"1. we cannot use same variable name"<<endl;
cout<<"2. we cannot use num/digits in variable name"<<endl;
cout<<"3. cannot use space in variable name"<<endl;





//Qno11. Write a program that declares an integer variable num and prints its value.
 cout<<"Ans11. it is simple tension nahi lene ka"<<endl;
 
 int number=10987;
 cout<<  number <<endl;
 
 
 
 //Qno12. Write a program that calculates and prints the perimeter of a rectangle.
//Assume the length is 10 and the width is 5.




//Qno13. What happens if you try to change the value of a constant variable?
// Write a program that demonstrates this.

//Qno14.create  that uses a string variable to store your name and prints it.
